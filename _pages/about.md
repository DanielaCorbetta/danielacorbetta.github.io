I am a PhD student in Statistics at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.unipd.it/en/) of the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/), advised by Davide Risso and Livio Finos. I am currently a Visiting Research Scholar at the [Center for Computational Biomedicine](https://computationalbiomed.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, where I work under the supervision of Robert Gentleman and Ludwig Geistlinger.

I am passionate about using statistical methodology to solve real biological problems.

Outside of Statistics, I love musicals and funny cats videos.
