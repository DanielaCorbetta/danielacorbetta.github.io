I am a PhD student in Statistics at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.unipd.it/en/) of the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/), advised by [Davide Risso](https://drisso.github.io/) and [Livio Finos](https://livioivil.github.io/). 
From November 2024 to May 2025, I have been a Visiting PhD student at the Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse, where I was supervised by [Pierre Neuvial](https://pneuvial.github.io/).
From February 2024 to July 2024, I have been a Visiting Research Scholar at the [Core for Computational Biomedicine](https://github.com/ccb-hms), Harvard University, where I worked under the supervision of [Robert Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician)) and [Ludwig Geistlinger](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/people/ludwig-geistlinger).

I am passionate about using statistical methodology to solve real biological problems.

I also really love cats.
