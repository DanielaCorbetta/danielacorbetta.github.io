I am a PhD student in Statistics at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.unipd.it/en/) of the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/), advised by [Davide Risso](https://drisso.github.io/) and [Livio Finos](https://livioivil.github.io/). I am currently a Visiting Research Scholar at the [Center for Computational Biomedicine](https://computationalbiomed.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, where I work under the supervision of [Robert Gentleman](https://computationalbiomed.hms.harvard.edu/about/people/robert-gentleman-phd/) and [Ludwig Geistlinger](https://computationalbiomed.hms.harvard.edu/about/people/ludwig-geistlinger-phd/).

I am passionate about using statistical methodology to solve real biological problems.

Outside of Statistics, I love musicals and funny cats videos.
